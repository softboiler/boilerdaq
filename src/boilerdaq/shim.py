    Parameters
    ----------
    board_num : int
        The number associated with the board when it was installed with InstaCal or created
        with :func:`.create_daq_device`.
    channel : int

        FILTER          When selected, a smoothing function is applied to temperature readings,
                        very much like the electrical smoothing inherent in all hand held
                        temperature sensor instruments. This is the default. When selected, 10
                        samples are read from the specified channel and averaged. The average is
                        the reading returned. Averaging removes normally distributed signal line
                        noise.
        --------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        NOFILTER        If you use the NOFILTER option then the readings will not be smoothed and
                        you will see a scattering of readings around a mean.

        WAITFORNEWDATA  Waits for new data to become available.

    Notes
    -----
    **Scale options**

    - Specify the TempScale.NOSCALE to the scale parameter to retrieve raw data from the device.
      When TempScale.NOSCALE is specified, calibrated data is returned, although a cold junction
      compensation (CJC) correction factor is not applied to the returned values.

    - Specify the :const:`~pyulmcculwms.TempScale.VOLTS` option to read the voltage input of a
      thermocouple.

    Refer to board-specific information in the Universal Library User's Guide to determine if your
    hardware supports these options.

    channel : int
        A/D channel number. The maximum allowable channel depends on which type of A/D

        gain feature, and others set the gain via switches on the board. In either case,
